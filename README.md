# MY 42 COMMON CORE EXPERIENCE

This contains all the projects I worked on during my time at 42 Vienna.\
(I only make them public, after they've been validated)

## Github Helper

If you need some advice on how to set up some stuff on Github, take a look at my \
‚ú® [How to Git Gud Guide](./How_To_Git_Gud.md) ‚ú®

## Discretion Advised

I advice **against** copying my code as it will not help you get better at Coding.
Before you even look at my code, ask yourself:
- Did I do research on the internet?
- Did I ask my peer on the left?
- Did I ask my peer on the right?
- Did I ask any peer that might know?

Good luck on your projects! üíñ
